# Machine Translation
Seq2seq model for Neural Machine Translation (NMT) from Spanish to English implemented in Keras

### Aproach :  
This task is performed using a  encoder-decoder LSTM model. In this architecture, the input sequence is encoded by a front-end model called the encoder then decoded word by word by a backend model called the decoder.
